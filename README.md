This is a placeholder, more to come.

This repo houses everything related to my homelab, which consists of 3 thinkcentres running proxmox, which each house a control plane and a worker node of my kubernetes cluster.

Massive shoutout to Riley Flynn ([@nint8835](https://github.com/nint8835)) and his [ops repo](https://github.com/nint8835/ops) for ~~inspiring me to build this homelab~~ doing all of the heavy lifting.
